Analysis of the telemetry data collected by Daikibo.
Using a data unification algorithm, the tech team at our client, Daikibo, has converted all telemetry data collected from its 4 factories:
Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 mins. Daikibo has been collecting this data for one month (May 2021) and they've shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.
